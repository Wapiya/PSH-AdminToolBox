# PSH-AdminToolBox
Powershell can save a lot of time or create a huge headache if you are working as an system administrator :-). Because I also often searched the web for ideas or solutions for a problem, I now want to spread my work to give some help for others who got stuck in similar situations - **_so keep calm and let the sysadmin handle it_**

## Scripts
The default location of code I develop (most just 'scripts' and no 'functions') because not all of the scripts I create are needed in daily tasks, so I donÂ´t save them in my 'AdminToolbox' module.
#### get-RandomPassword
Easy to use script to get a randomized password based on a predfined 'salt'

## Modules
Those scripts I needed most got wrapped in a 'function' and stored in my 'module' so the are small building blocks in an modular working 'AdminToolbox'.

### Support me a bit :-)
If you buy me a coffe you not just support my 'daily fuel' to keep my brain running smooth, but you also motivate me to further improve my work. 
It also gives me a good feeling someone else likes what I have done or maybe has also a benefet at his job through using a script of mine :-)
